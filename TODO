- double-rep of genes - crossover-compatible rep, but also list of city indices


- an individual should have a validity check which is called optionally after mutations or after children are created
-- for debugging/observation, not running


PERF NOTES
- remember that prepending and popping first are fast w/ elixir lists b/c cons


HAPPENING NOW
- working on the scoring, which means working on the cities...


* need to be able to seed random in *one* place for result repro
* parallelism
* gpu?
* be able to save state and continue a run
* add license
* add second experiment, perhaps factoring or something weird?
