- a route has C cities
- a chromosome is a list of integers C-1 items long
-- each item is the index of one of the cities not yet chosen for route

- cities live within the square between (0,0) and (1,1)
- score is 2^0.5 * (C-1) - D (where D is actual distance)

- chromosome should be able to spit out its own route, but route should be eval'ed lazily

- a chromosome should have a validity check which is called optionally after mutations or after children are created


PERF NOTES
- remember that prepending and popping first are fast w/ elixir lists b/c cons

HAPPENING NOW
- factor experiment needs to suck in primes, and use the prime list to seed initial population
- ts experiment needs to generate an appropriately constructed set of random paths


* need to be able to seed random in *one* place for result repro
* parallelism
* gpu?
* be able to save state and continue a run
* add license
